It has always been some form of research that led great men and women create and pass on legacies that built civilizations and made them flourish. Research is still persistent among humankind who keep finding interesting ways to get better with each passing moment. What was termed as research in the 13th century would not be the same at this time. Methods of research have also evolved, simply from looking at something and replicating it, to measure and enhance and experiment hypotheses over the years.
