I"G<p>It was in the Winter Semester, 2021-22 when we were introduced to the course, Microprocessors. I had a relatively proper understanding of the Computer Architecture, and my professor re-iterated that this course would help us understand computers deeper, and that there is a world beyond the desktops and laptops that accompanies us in our lives, in the form of embedded computers. It was at a time when the weather was hardly winter-like, and when I happened to stumble on to a news article reporting that deaths due to traffic accidents was at an all-time high.

<p><br /></p>

<p>The goal of the project is to determine the speed of a vehicle by using the time elapsed and distance travelled from the starting point to the end point. The architecture of the proposed solution contains 4 stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detection of the vehicle</li>
  <li>Track the vehicle and obtain the speed of the image</li>
  <li>Obtain image captures of the number plate of the vehicles over speed limit.</li>
  <li>Processing of the images captured.</li>
</ul>

<p>The start and the end coordinates are initially set. Then a video of the moving vehicle is obtained using the CCTV camera setup. The distance between the start and the end point is approximated. This will be used as the distance for estimating the speed in the speed calculation stage. The video frames are collected and processed. Using the video frames, image frames would be extracted using an appropriate software. These images generated would then be enhanced again and processed.</p>
