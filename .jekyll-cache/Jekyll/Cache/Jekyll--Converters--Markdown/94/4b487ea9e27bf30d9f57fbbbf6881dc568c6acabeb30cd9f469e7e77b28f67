I"`<p>Human beings have evolved over thousands of years, growing, and developing by identifying and making proper use of resources in our environment. Observing and replicating phenomenon is what brought us miles ahead, from the invention of the wheel, to the flying of the first aircraft. It has always been some form of research that led great men and women create and pass on legacies that built civilizations and made them flourish. Research is still persistent among humankind who keep finding interesting ways to get better with each passing moment. What was termed as research in the 13th century would not be the same at this time. Methods of research have also evolved, simply from looking at something and replicating it, to measure and enhance and experiment hypotheses over the years. The foundation of the research process has remained the same: observing. Research in the modern age has brought us some powerful tools that have accelerated our growth in many fields. How has the process changed in the Digital Age?</p>

<p>Research in the last two decades has found new techniques to solve real world problems. For example, the field of computational biology and Bio-informatics were unheard of three decades ago. But the industry is now worth around $8,614.29 million as of last year. A very groundbreaking example of the use of computers in aiding biological research is the Human Genome Project. The project involved an international research effort to determine the DNA sequence of the entire human genome. Fifty years ago, this was an impossible task to accomplish, given the volume of data that needs to be processed and analyzed by thousands of researchers around the world. But the process took about thirteen years with the use of computational tools, which itself was a whole two years ahead of schedule. How did they manage to accomplish this mammoth of a task? Biological research has traditionally been a very individualistic enterprise, with researchers pursuing medical investigations independently. The magnitude of technological challenge prompted the project to assemble interdisciplinary teams, encompassing engineering and informatics apart from biology. They automated procedures wherever possible, and concentrated research in major centers. Interestingly, the genome project with the current advancements in computational power and cloud storage and processing capabilities would take $1000 and only two days. The original project cost $1 billion.

Another notable use of computational tools in research is in the field of Computational Social Science. The first famous research demonstrating the capabilities of including computational techniques in social science research was from the University of California. Professor Joshua Blumenstock and his team’s work in Rwanda shows a powerful result which is precedent to many attempts in their field. Their research involved identifying wealth patterns across the country of Rwanda using one of the most unconventional sources: mobile phone logs. They were able to access and analyze mobile phone data from millions of mobile phones in use across Rwanda, and using machine learning and feature engineering techniques, they were able to identify features linked to wealth, and was able to provide a clear map of the wealth distribution in the country, accurate to the street. This was a breakthrough for economic research in the last decade, where most research in the field of social science and economics involve egregious and painstaking field work, collecting survey data and manually analyzing and categorizing it in a process that takes years producing a result with little accuracy. Traditionally, governments relied on the official census to gather data of income and wealth. This was significant to many countries in East Africa, where a census has not been taken in decades and issues such as conflicts and instability in government procedures provide wildly inaccurate results with which important economic decisions are taken. The effective design, implementation and evaluation of public policies rely on accurate socio-economic data. It would be impossible, for instance, to implement a poverty alleviation program without knowing who the relevant target populations are, where they live, and their economic status. As the United Nations Population Fund puts it, “without accurate data, those most in need remain invisible.”</p>

<p>Professor Blumenstock’s research and the Human Genome Project are two significant accomplishments in their fields, both of which were aided using computational methods. Every researcher now is required to understand and operate new software, and they are embracing such tools which make their work easier. Many industries have been born in the last decade, finding new ways to automate various forms of research methods, an industry that is growing at an unprecedented rate. As we progress to inventing innovative technologies or discovering phenomena, all of which are a result of extensive research, it is imperative that the use of powerful computers in data analysis would accelerate the process, and more accurately as well.</p>
