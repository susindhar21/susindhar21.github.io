<p>Human beings have evolved over thousands of years, growing, and developing by identifying and making proper use of resources in our environment. Observing and replicating phenomenon is what brought us miles ahead, from the invention of the wheel, to the flying of the first aircraft. It has always been some form of research that led great men and women create and pass on legacies that built civilizations and made them flourish. Research is still persistent among humankind who keep finding interesting ways to get better with each passing moment. What was termed as research in the 13th century would not be the same at this time. Methods of research have also evolved, simply from looking at something and replicating it, to measure and enhance and experiment hypotheses over the years. The foundation of the research process has remained the same: observing. Research in the modern age has brought us some powerful tools that have accelerated our growth in many fields. How has the process changed in the Digital Age?</p>

<p>Research in the last two decades has found new techniques to solve real world problems. For example, the field of computational biology and Bio-informatics were unheard of three decades ago. But the industry is now worth around $8,614.29 million as of last year. A very groundbreaking example of the use of computers in aiding biological research is the Human Genome Project. The project involved an international research effort to determine the DNA sequence of the entire human genome. Fifty years ago, this was an impossible task to accomplish, given the volume of data that needs to be processed and analyzed by thousands of researchers around the world. But the process took about thirteen years with the use of computational tools, which itself was a whole two years ahead of schedule. How did they manage to accomplish this mammoth of a task? Biological research has traditionally been a very individualistic enterprise, with researchers pursuing medical investigations independently. The magnitude of technological challenge prompted the project to assemble interdisciplinary teams, encompassing engineering and informatics apart from biology. They automated procedures wherever possible, and concentrated research in major centers. Interestingly, the genome project with the current advancements in computational power and cloud storage and processing capabilities would take $1000 and only two days. The original project cost $1 billion.</p>
