I"B<p>It was in the Winter Semester, 2021-22 when we were introduced to the course, Microprocessors. I had a relatively proper understanding of the Computer Architecture, and my professor re-iterated that this course would help us understand computers deeper, and that there is a world beyond the desktops and laptops that accompanies us in our lives, in the form of embedded computers. It was at a time when the weather was hardly winter-like, and when I happened to stumble on to a news article reporting that deaths due to traffic accidents was at an all-time high.

<h4 id="goal-of-the-project">Goal of the Project</h4>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The goal of the project is to determine the speed of a vehicle by using the time elapsed and distance travelled from the starting point to the end point. The architecture of the proposed solution contains 4 stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detection of the vehicle</li>
  <li>Track the vehicle and obtain the speed of the image</li>
  <li>Obtain image captures of the number plate of the vehicles over speed limit.</li>
  <li>Processing of the images captured.</li>
</ul>

<p>The start and the end coordinates are initially set. Then a video of the moving vehicle is obtained using the CCTV camera setup. The distance between the start and the end point is approximated. This will be used as the distance for estimating the speed in the speed calculation stage. The video frames are collected and processed. Using the video frames, image frames would be extracted using an appropriate software. These images generated would then be enhanced again and processed.
<br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h4>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The architecture consists of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Camera setup: Two CCTV cameras are set up at a distance from each other to cover the area of interest.</li>
  <li>Object detection: Each camera captures video footage and feeds it into an object detection system. The system identifies objects within the video frames and extracts features such as position, size, and orientation.</li>
  <li>Object tracking: The object detection system tracks the identified objects over time and records their positions at different time intervals. To track the objects across cameras, we can use a multi-camera tracking algorithm that fuses the data from both cameras and produces a single track for each object.</li>
  <li>Speed calculation: Once we have the positions of the objects at different time intervals, we can calculate their speed by dividing the distance they covered by the time elapsed between the two intervals.</li>
  <li>Output visualization: The speed data can be displayed in a graphical format that shows the speed of each object over time.</li>
  <li>Alert system: An alert system can be set up to notify the user when the speed of an object exceeds a predefined threshold. This can be useful in scenarios where speeding vehicles or objects pose a safety risk.</li>
</ol>

<p>To implement this architecture, we can use a combination of computer vision and ma1 chine learning techniques such as object detection, tracking, and multicamera fusion. Open-source libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch can be used to develop the object detection and tracking systems. The output data can be stored in a database or cloud storage for further analysis or visualization.</p>
